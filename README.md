# C# Unexpected Default Value Initialization Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in C# related to unexpected default value initialization within constructors.  The bug highlights a scenario where initializing a property to a default value in a constructor may not behave as expected, potentially leading to unexpected program behavior or errors.  This issue is often subtle and can be challenging to track down during testing.

## Bug Description

The primary issue lies in the default initialization of class members within the constructor. When objects are deeply nested, implicit default values can conflict with explicit initializations, causing difficult-to-debug issues. This is particularly important in situations involving complex objects or inheritance.
